There are a lot of libraries that offer this type of functionally but this often means, loading hundreds of kilobytes of Javascript and CSS. I my case I justed wanted simple sticky note functionally. I want a draggable element and a “dragger” handle with which I can drag the element. It had to be simple and flexible, extendible, no initialization code, it had to have support for nested draggables and should always stay within the parent element (the draggable area).
